# Claude Code Sub-Agents Collection

A comprehensive collection of specialized sub-agents for Claude Code, designed to enhance development workflows through domain-specific expertise and intelligent task delegation.

## What are Sub-Agents?

Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants in Claude Code that focus on specific domains of software engineering. They provide expert-level guidance, automate complex tasks, and coordinate with other agents to deliver comprehensive solutions. Learn more in the [official documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents).

## Usage Examples

### Project Orchestrator Template

Use this template to start any project with Claude Code. This will automatically engage the project-orchestrator sub agent to analyze your requirements and delegate tasks to the appropriate specialized agents:

```
Use project-orchestrator sub agent to build [WHAT YOU WANT].

Name: [PROJECT NAME]
Type: [APPLICATION TYPE - Web App/API/Mobile/CLI/etc]
Goal: [MAIN OBJECTIVE - What problem does this solve?]
Features: [KEY FEATURES - List core functionality]
Tech Stack:
  - Frontend: [e.g., Vue, Next.js, React, Angular]
  - Backend: [e.g., Node.js, Python/Django, Go]
  - Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis]
  - Other: [e.g., Docker, AWS, Authentication method]
Priority: [WHAT MATTERS MOST - Speed/Security/Scalability/UX/Performance]
Constraints: [ANY LIMITATIONS - Budget/Time/Platform/Compliance]

Analyze requirements, create comprehensive project plan, and delegate to all necessary sub agents for complete implementation.
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific about your features to get better results
- Tech Stack sections are optional - remove any that don't apply
- The project-orchestrator will automatically identify and engage the right sub-agents
- For frontend-only projects, simply omit Backend/Database/Other sections

### Basic Agent Invocation
```bash
# Use a specific agent for a focused task
claude --agent security-auditor "Review this authentication flow for vulnerabilities"
claude --agent frontend-specialist "Create a responsive navbar component with shadcn/ui"
```

### Project Orchestration
```bash
# Let the project orchestrator coordinate multiple agents
claude --agent project-orchestrator "Build a user management system with authentication, CRUD operations, and admin dashboard"
```

### Sequential Agent Workflows
```bash
# Chain agents for comprehensive coverage
claude --agent backend-architect "Design the API structure" \
      --agent security-auditor "Review the security implications" \
      --agent test-architect "Create a testing strategy"
```

## Key Features

### ü§ñ Automatic Delegation
Many agents automatically delegate tasks to appropriate specialists:
- **backend-architect** ‚Üí **security-auditor** for vulnerability assessment
- **frontend-specialist** ‚Üí **performance-profiler** for optimization
- **project-orchestrator** ‚Üí Multiple agents based on project requirements

### üéØ Domain Expertise
Each agent provides:
- Specialized knowledge in their domain
- Best practices and industry standards
- Framework-specific guidance
- Performance optimization techniques

### üîÑ Intelligent Coordination
Agents work together to:
- Avoid duplicate work
- Ensure consistency across domains
- Share context and requirements
- Validate cross-domain compatibility

## Best Practices

### When to Use Specific Agents

**Use `project-orchestrator`** when:
- Starting a new feature or project
- Requirements span multiple domains
- You need coordination between frontend, backend, and testing

**Use domain specialists** when:
- You have a specific technical challenge
- You need expert-level guidance in one area
- You want focused, high-quality output

**Use `test-architect`** when:
- Planning testing strategies
- Setting up new test infrastructure
- Defining quality gates and coverage goals

### Agent Selection Tips

1. **Start Broad**: Use `project-orchestrator` for complex, multi-faceted tasks
2. **Go Specific**: Use domain experts for focused technical work
3. **Chain Workflows**: Combine agents for comprehensive coverage
4. **Leverage Auto-Delegation**: Let agents coordinate with each other

## Installation & Setup

### Quick Installation
To make these agents globally accessible in Claude Code, copy all `.md` files to your Claude Code agents directory:

```bash
# Copy all agent files to make them globally accessible
cp *.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Or clone and copy from this repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sub-agents
cp *.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Verify Installation
Check that agents are available:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/agents/
# Should show all 25 agent files
```

## Integration with Claude Code

### Configuration
Agents are automatically available in Claude Code once placed in the agents directory. No additional configuration required.

### Memory Integration
Agents work with Claude Code's memory system to:
- Remember project context across sessions
- Share knowledge between agents
- Maintain consistency in recommendations
